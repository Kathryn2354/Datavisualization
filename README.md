# **Worldwide burden of Tuberculosis (Tb): risk factors and age/gender disparities**

<h3 style="Text-align:center;">Kathryn Li</h3>

## Introduction

<p style="color:black;">The core discovery of this research is 3-fold. First, we found the countries with the greatest number of Tb are almost exclusively developing countries, with India, Philippines, China, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa, and Bangladesh rounded up top 8. Second, more males are having Tb than females. Third, the majority of Tb patients are 15-year-old or older. Fourth, the most possible risk factors include undernourishment, smoking, and alcohol consumption.</p>

<p style="color:black;">The supporting arguments for the discovery are the extensive worldwide surveys on the Tb burden related to age, sex, and health issues including diabetes, HIV infection, smoking, alcohol consumption, and undernourishment.</p>

## Dataset
<p style="color:black;">The dataset was obtained from the Global Tuberculosis Reports 2021 prepared by World Health Organization (WHO) ([link](https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/data)). The data is about the Tb burden worldwide, sorted by countries in alphabetical order. The data are collected from each country with consideration of age, sex, and health issues including diabetes, HIV infection, smoking, alcohol consumption, and undernourishment. </p>

<p style="color:black;">I’m interested in this topic because in general, I’m interested in most topics related to human diseases. Tb is one of the major infectious diseases worldwide, although it is not very prevalent in the US. I heard Tb is highly prevalent in the under-developed countries where hygiene conditions are poor. I want to confirm this on my own with reliable data. WHO is certainly one of the most reliable sources for my purpose. </p>

<p style="color:black;">The data was collected by WHO Global. The aim is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the Tb epidemic, and of progress in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease at global, regional, and country levels. It was done in the context of global Tb commitments, strategies, and targets. </p>

## Initial Questions

<p style="color:black;">As I mentioned earlier, I was drawn to this data because I’m interested in Tb prevalence around the world. Since I heard Tb is highly prevalent in the under-developed countries where hygiene conditions are poor, I was curious if what I heard is true. As I worked with the data, three questions came up: 1) Is it true that Tb is more prevalent in poor countries? 2) Does Tb affect particular age groups? 3) What are the health risk factors for Tb infection? And 4) Does Tb infection have any gender bias? </p>

<p style="color:black;"> The data that surprised me the most are 1) undernourishment turns out to be the most obvious health risk factor for Tb (This seems to make sense, as undernourishment is a major health issue in poor countries where Tb is more prevalent). 2) most Tb patients are 15-years old or older, while infection of infants (0-4 years old) is rare. 3) More males are Tb-infected than females. 4) Since drug addiction is an important risk factor for many infectious diseases such as HIV, I was surprised why drug addicts were not included in the surveys of Tb burden. </p>

<p style="color:black;">Generally, it is not as hard as I initially anticipated to work with the data, although the dataset is very large and relatively complicated with many parameters. I have to initially sort the data carefully by the specific parameters and then mix-match them in TABLEAU to identify useful conclusions. </p>

## Conclusion

<p style="color:black;"> 1) Tb is most prevalent in developing countries. 2) more males are having Tb than females. 3) Tb is most prevalent in patients who are 15 years old or older. 4) The most possible risk factors include undernourishment, smoking, and alcohol consumption. </p>
